Basic level:

Implement the User class. When creating an instance based on this class, the object should have the form {name: 'Petro', role: 'admin'} (the role can be either admin or user). If the data of such an object is transferred incorrectly, the corresponding field should be alerted with an alert message. <br>

The User class must have the following components:

getName
getRole
login
logout
changeName
changePassword

The Admin class should have the following components:

addUser
removeUser
changeUserRole
getAllUsers
removeAllUsers


Intermediate level:<br>

In the HTML page, add the ability for the user to create their own dashboard of clocks. These are clocks for different parts of the world. You need to add an input field and a button that will create a new clock when clicked. WorldClock is implemented through a class. Each instance of this class is a new clock. The class must have the following components:

getCurrentDate
getCurrentDateTime
deleteClock
1 button - shows the user the time in text format
Button 2 - shows the user the current date and time in text form

3 button - removes the clock from the "wall" of clocks
